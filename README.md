Child's Play, for the Thematic Theme Framework
===============

Child's Play is built with the [Responsive Base Child Theme](http://scottnix.com/responsive-base-a-child-theme-for-thematic/) for Thematic, which is a mobile-first approach to responsive web design. It is unique in that it is a SASS/Compass child theme, it is my first attempt at playing with CSS preprocessors. It includes all the benefits of the Responsive Base Theme, but incorporates WooThemes Flexslider, adds a header widget and has a much better visual appeal

It is intended to work best with the latest version of Thematic 2.0+, but works on 0.9.7.7 and above.

While this theme "works", I highly suggest moving to [Responsive Base Plus](http://scottnix.com/responsive-base-plus) which is actively maintained with all the latest and greatest code and practices.
